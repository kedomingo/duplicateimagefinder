# Duplicate Image Finder
A simple PHP script that finds duplicate photos in a a given directory. 

## Usage

```
php finder.php  -d <input dir> -t <threshold percent>

php finder.php  -d testfolder -t 60
```

### Options
* -t, --threshold - Similarity Threshold in percent. Scores lower than this will not be reported as similar
* -d, --dir - Input directory
* -m, --match-priority - Prioritize files with higher similarity instead of prioritizing larger files. This is faulty when you have a high resolution file, and several duplicated smaller files. The smaller files will be matched 100% with each other and will rank higher (will delete the bigger file)
* --move-duplicates - Will remove the duplicates from the input directory and move them to a backup directory

## Algorithm
Files are recursively fetched in the given directory. Each image file is compared to one another by:
1. Downsampling them to 32px
1. Comparing their dimension (10% of the score)
2. Comparing their color (90% of the score)

### Dimension
Since both images are resized to the same width, the resulting height will be used as contributing factor to the comparison. When 2 images vary in height drastically (e.g. one is in landscape orientation while the other is in portrait), it will lower the total score of the comparison

### Color
Because the images are resized to a tiny 32px wide image, the colors can be compared pixel by pixel. Starting from the top left to the bottom right coordinate of the smaller image, the pixels of the two images being checked are compared for similarity. The closeness of the red, green, and blue values are calculated separately then averaged.

Demo using the reddish hues #f3d2e4 and #f9c7f7:

```
$e = rgb(243,210,228)
$d = rgb(249,199,247)
$r_score = 243 / 249 = 0.9759
$g_score = 199 / 210 = 0.9476
$b_score = 228 / 247 = 0.9231
$rgb_closeness_score = (0.9759 + 0.9476 + 0.9231) / 3 = 0.9489
```

The scores of each pixel compared are averaged to get the total color-comparison score

### Limitations

#### Performance
This is a bad solution because each file are being compared to each other,
then between two files, all the pixels are being compared. A directory with 1,000 files will require 1,000,000 comparisons. 
This will be worse if the images in the directory are large, say, more than 1mb.

#### Accuracy
This is a na√Øve solution written as a quick workaround to paid apps. The objective of this solution is to find almost exact matches. No AI is involved.

A more robust approach to image similarity should also take into a account not just the colors in the same positions, but also whether the objects in the image has shifted (the colors will not match in the same coordinates). This will require a more advanced solution.
